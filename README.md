# Project---Bank-Customer-Retention
Goal: Identify key drivers of customer churn for a retail bank to support customer retention strategies.

Solution: Conducted EDA using SQL and Excel to uncover churn patterns, built Tableau dashboards to visualize credit
utilization and spending behaviour, and analyzed factors such as age, income, and transaction frequency.

Result: Discovered that 40â€“50-year-old low-income customers had the highest churn rate; identified that 86.9% of
customers remained active while 13.1% churned; recommended personalized outreach, informing targeted retention
campaigns.
